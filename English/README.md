> [!WARNING]
> ### ⚠️ Disclaimer
>
> This skills library is an auxiliary tool for legal professionals. It does **not** provide legal advice, does **not** constitute legal conclusions, and **cannot** replace a lawyer. Each skill's output should be regarded as a draft for review by a qualified legal professional, not as a final product to be used externally or relied upon for decisions.
>
> - Checklists, analytical frameworks, risk prompts, and summaries of statutes or jurisprudential rules in the skills are aids for reviewers and do not represent the project's stance on the law.
> - This repository is intended for the **PRC statutory law** context. In civil law systems, cases do not have universal binding effect (except for guiding cases by the Supreme People's Court); analogical reasoning is strictly limited or prohibited in areas like criminal law elements and tax law. When applying skills to other jurisdictions (Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, common law systems, etc.), users must adjust the legal assumptions accordingly.
> - AI-generated reasoning and conclusions may contain biases, omissions, or be outdated. **Final legal determinations must be made by qualified legal professionals who bear the corresponding responsibility.**

## 🧭 Design Philosophy

This skills library is not a collection of disconnected prompts but a **layered legal reasoning system**.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### 🧩 Atomic Abilities × 36

Each skill does one thing: retrieve a statute, extract a set of elements, perform a deduction, or evaluate an argument's strength.

They are the smallest callable, composable units.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### 🎼 Compound Abilities × 2 ✦

`judgment-document-generation` and `legal-judgment-prediction` are orchestration layers.

They do not introduce new abilities but schedule multiple atomic abilities in fixed flows to complete end-to-end complex tasks.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

The orchestration flow for compound abilities:

```
Fact element extraction → Concept comprehension → Issue identification → Statute retrieval → Case retrieval → Deductive reasoning → Rule application → Terminology normalization
```

Each `SKILL.md` includes: **trigger conditions · capability boundaries · operational steps · input/output format · legal disclaimer**. Compound abilities explicitly state which atomic abilities they call and in what order.

> 💡 **Why emphasize "hand‑written"?** These skills are individually authored and validated by practicing legal professionals to match Chinese legal reasoning and practice standards, rather than being generic, model-generated prompts.

## 🚀 Usage

These skills follow the Anthropic Agent Skills `SKILL.md` convention and can be used in any compatible environment—such as **Claude Code**, **Claude Cowork**, or other compatible platforms.

```text
1. Place the required skill directories (any subdirectory under `skills/`) into your skills folder
2. Describe the legal task in natural language — the model will match and invoke appropriate skills based on the `description` trigger conditions
3. Invoke compound abilities for complex tasks (full judgment generation, outcome prediction) and they will automatically schedule required atomic abilities
4. ⚠️ Every output must be reviewed by a qualified legal professional before use
```

### 🔌 External Data via MCP

The library's retrieval skills (`case-retrieval` · `legal-article-retrieval` · `legal-norm-validity-check`) **only define retrieval methodology and do not bind to any database**. To enable retrieval of real, current, and auditable cases and statutes (rather than relying on model memory), the runtime environment must connect to a legal data service compatible with the Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)).

The skills expect a minimal interface—an environment tool that accepts an input query and returns structured results—so any case/statute database can be integrated. Verified available option: **PKULAW MCP** (Peking University Law Database) with 160M+ cases and 5M+ statutes. Configure by adding a standard server to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pkulaw": {
      "url": "https://apim-gw.pkulaw.com/{SERVICE_ID}/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```

> Tokens and `SERVICE_ID` are retrieved from the PKULAW MCP console. **Configure them in your local client only; do not put tokens in `SKILL.md` or commit them to the repository**.
> Full services, links, and integration steps are in [MCP-PKULAW.md](./MCP-PKULAW.md); each skill's integration contract is in its directory README.md.
> ⚠️ If no database is connected, skills can still run but all cases/statutes must be annotated `[to be retrieved]`/`[to be checked]`; do not fabricate.

## 🤝 Submit a New Skill

We welcome community contributions. **No deep Git expertise required**—you can submit a skill and maintainers will review it for inclusion.

<div align="center">

### 👉 [**Submit a new Skill here!**](../../issues/new?template=submit-skill.yml)

</div>

**Review process:**

1. **Safety first** — check for malicious code, risky content, or inappropriate dependencies.
2. **Legal quality** — reviewed by practicing legal professionals: clear triggers, accurate capability boundaries, alignment with PRC statutory reasoning and practice norms.
3. **Practical value** — assess whether the skill provides usable assistance.

**Minimum to submit a skill:**

- Create a new directory under `skills/` named by the skill slug (lowercase hyphen).
- Add a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter.
- In `description`, state: **trigger conditions · applicable scenarios · capability boundaries**.
- For compound abilities, explicitly list the atomic abilities called and the call sequence.
